WOP personal learning project, trying to create the "Pokedex", a database containing the information of Pokemon. 

NEW!
PokedexV2.py: 

Program now displays different colored typings! Also works with dual-type pokemon.

Program starts on a home screen (shaped like a Pokedex) where the user can search a Pokemon based on Name or Pokedex Number. 
Pressing the button then opens up a new window titled "Pokedex Entry" which has the layout of a Pokedex Entry Screen similar to the game.
This new window displays the sprite, pokedex number, name, type, height, weight, and base stats. 
The user can keep searching Pokemon and have multiple windows open with different dex entries. 
If the user does not type in an existing Pokemon, or there is an unkwown error, the "MISSINGNO" dex entry appears, a reference to the game glitch. 


Future ideas/functions to be implemented:

-do not let the user open up multiple of the same pokedex entry

-Add an autofill feature to the entry box to help the user type in a pokemon

-Add buttons to the dex entry window that show what typings are weak against or super effective to that pokemon

-Add a button that shows the back of the sprite

-Add new entry box on home page where user can input a type, and a list of all the Pokemon with that type will appear


Pokedex.py: My first attempt at a Pokedex (and my first python program ever)

Code uses an entry box that allows the user to search a Pokemon based on Name or Pokedex Number.
When a Pokemon is searched, it will display the Pokedex Number, Name, Sprite, Type, Weight, Height, and Base Stats. 
Work on this program was halted when a new idea was born... see PokedexV2.py!
