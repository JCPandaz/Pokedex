WOP personal learning project, trying to create the "Pokedex", a database containing the information of Pokemon. 

Code currently uses an entry box that allows the user to search a Pokemon based on Name or Pokedex Number.
When a Pokemon is searched, it will display the Pokedex Number, Name, Sprite, Type, Weight, Height, and Base Stats.


Future functions to be implemented:

-Display the Pokemon's ability

-Display the Pokemon's moveset, the learning method, and the level it can learn the move

-Display multiple sprites from different generations

-Give the user the option to which statistics will appear (i.e. they can choose just name and type or just sprite and base stats)
