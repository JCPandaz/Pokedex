WOP personal learning project, trying to create the "Pokedex", a database containing the information of Pokemon. 

NEW!
PokedexV2.py: 

Program starts on a home screen (shaped like a Pokedex) where the user can search a Pokemon based on Name or Pokedex Number. 
Pressing the button then opens up a new window titled "Pokedex Entry" which has the layout of a Pokedex Entry Screen similar to the game.
This new window displays the sprite, pokedex number, name, type, height, weight, and base stats. 
The user can keep searching Pokemon and have multiple windows open with different dex entries. 
If the user does not type in an existing Pokemon, or there is an unkwown error, the "MISSINGNO" dex entry appears, a reference to the game glitch. 


Future ideas/functions to be implemented:

-do not let the user open up multiple of the same pokedex entry
-Make each type correspond to a different color font when displayed (i.e grass is green, fire is red, etc)



Pokedex.py: My first attempt at a Pokedex (and my first python program ever)
Code uses an entry box that allows the user to search a Pokemon based on Name or Pokedex Number.
When a Pokemon is searched, it will display the Pokedex Number, Name, Sprite, Type, Weight, Height, and Base Stats. 
Work on this program was halted when a new idea was born... see PokedexV2.py!
